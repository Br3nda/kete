Kete trunk versions later than r1148 have additional privacy control code.

The following instructions are for use when updating from a trunk version of Kete to 
a version r1167 or later.

Assuming you have a functional and unmodified trunk version of Kete, the following upgrade
instructions should work:

NB: All commands must be made from the main Kete application directory.

1.      Stop your Kete server.
2.      Run the database migration 'rake db:migrate'
                NB: This adds new columns to tables in the kete database. If you have customized Kete or
                need to reverse the upgrade, this may cause issues. See migrations 046 through 055 in
                /db/migrate/ for an insight into the database schema changes made.
3.      Run the upgrade script: 'rake kete:upgrade'
4.      Start your Kete server again.
