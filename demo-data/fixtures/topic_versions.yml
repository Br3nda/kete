  description: <p>               Mike               Walker started his film               career as a cadet graphic               artist in the National               Publicity Studios of the               Tourist and Publicity               Department. In 1951 he               joined Bob Morrow, a film               animation artist, at Morrow               Productions an independent               company specialising in             animated documentaries.              </p> <p>For Morrow Productions               Mike Walker worked as               a director, producer and               co-writer on <em>Kingi&rsquo;s               Story</em> (1981), <em>Kingpin</em>              (1985) and <em>Mark               II</em> (1987).               Dealing with the lives               of young Maori in contemporary               New Zealand, the trilogy   received critical acclaim for raising   important social issues.</p>              In 1992 Mike Walker left             filmmaking to concentrate             on photography. A large             collection of films and             documentation from Morrow             Productions is deposited             with the Film Archive. <br /> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

  title: Waitarere Beach
  short_summary: "West coast beach within the Horowhenua District. "
  id: "4"
  description: <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Waitarere          Beach, one of the best-kept secrets of the North Islands west coast is          regarded as the place to go when you want to get away from it all. Within          easy commuting distance from New Zealand&#39;s Capital city Wellington, and          from nearby Palmerston North, Waitarere beach is an ideal spot for either          a weekend getaway or as a permanent residence. </font>           <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Waitarere            Beach community includes a well-stocked 4 Square Store, takeaways, caf&eacute;            and restaurant. Levin, the nearest town is 10 minutes easy drive should            you need something more.</font></p>           <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The            Waitarere beach is wide and sandy allowing plenty of room for all your            favourite beach activities including land yachts, 4 wheel motor bikes,            surfing and fishing. The beach slowly drops off into deep water so there&#39;s            plenty of safe paddling space for the youngsters and during the summer            months, the surf club set up patrol. </font></p>           <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Waitarere            Beach is also a popular fishing spot where Kowhai, Snapper, Groper,            Gurnard, Flounder and Soul are the most common catches. The large, flat            beach is ideal to back your boat with a tractor or a four-wheel drive.            During the Whitebait season you can find a spot to sit your net at the            Manawatu or the Ohau river mouths.</font></p>           <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A            well-established forest surrounds Waitarere Beach and is host to several            popular annual events such as the &#39;Great Forest Marathon&#39;. Orienteering,            and Mountain biking also make use of the forest floor and bring in a            lot of interest from outside the Horowhenua. The forest is a popular            spot to walk your dog and with the many tracks cutting through to the            beach, you can enjoy the forest one way and the beach on the way back!</font></p>           <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Come and            discover for yourself the peace and tranquillity of this waterfront            paradise that is Waitarere Beach.</font></p>

  title: The Beige Brigade
  short_summary: "Group of NZ cricket supporters who are noted for wearing the 80's style Brown and Tan cricket uniforms. "
  id: "7"
  description: <p>We are the one and only Beige Brigade&reg; - accept no imitations! We are the relentless clappers, the bearers of Larry the Small Horse, the residents of Beige 13. Kicking off in 1999 and then making a name for ourselves in 2002 when we rampaged around Australia letting Michael Bevan know about his custard arm. </p> <p>The Beige Brigade&reg; love cricket and we want to get New Zealanders passionate and excited about the game. Wins are nice but we&#39;re long haul supporters - not some disgruntled, cynical bunch of old buggers who leap on a loss like it&#39;s the end of the world. </p> <p>The hardcore of the Beige Brigade&reg; is a bunch of everyday chaps from heartland New Zealand (Tauranga, Hamilton, Wellington, Westport, Christchurch, New Plymouth, Marlborough) who believe clamorous, optimistic, boisterous support is what every New Zealand cricket team needs. </p> <p>The Beige Brigade&reg; has been piling along to games in New Zealand for many years, just quietly going about our support, and occasionally doling out a bit of abuse where it was warranted. Generally it&#39;s all about being relentlessly positive but Glenn McGrath (lived in a caravan), Damien Martyn (shagged a girl off the telly), Michael Clarke (shaves his arms), Inzamam ul-Haq (fat), Abdul/Abdur Razzaq (keeps changing his name), Brian Strang (can&#39;t bowl straight), Mark Boucher (angry), Andre Nel (nutcase) and Runako Morton (psycho) have all deserved a word or two of advice. </p> <p>Certainly things went off their tits during the 2002 Carlton United series. We went quite silly in Sydney where Australia self-destructed. We got totally carried away in Brisbane where NZ shrugged off the South African monkey on their back thanks to a man named Cairns. We went pretty hard in Adelaide, and let Australia know what we thought of their Australia Day party. Backing up for the South African game the next day was tough but we did that too. In Melbourne Michael &#39;Custard Arm&#39; Bevan broke our collective hearts but not our spirit in an unforgettable game of cricket. </p> <p>We&#39;ve done a lot. We went to England in May 2004 for a month of magical days including every ball of a Test match at Lord&#39;s, went to to the appalling Super Series in Melbourne (2005), spent our money in Queenstown, plus a bunch of games in Auckland and Wellington to boot. This summer we&#39;re heading back to Aussie for the VB Series and some of us will get to the World Cup cricket. We bought the Ball from the unforgettable underarm81 game in 2005, we led the return to beige for the Black Caps in 2004, we held the hugely successful Moustache and Facial Hair competition for the NZ team in the first 20/20 international, we lycra clad Mark Richardson (and Darren Lehmann), we issued the Pash For Cash challenge, we&#39;ve got in behind the legends at Pulp Sport.</p> <p>As well as the trusty Beige Brigade Shop we now have one idiot stationed in an office in Covent Garden as our northern hemispehere logistics maanger (on zero pay), we have a Podcast (The BYC - yeah you know me), a Blog and most importantly we have a bloody good time. </p> <p>So, if you see our marvellous home sewed banner emblazoned with &quot;Beige 13&quot; or the Kiwi flag flying high, wander over and have a quiet jar or two with us at the New Zealand games. Rest assured, (if we can get the leave from work) we&#39;ll be making ourselves at home in our little corner of the ground. </p> <p>The Beige Brigade&reg; is a 100% Kiwi institution and we will be here for a long time to come. The shirts are an icon of Kiwi pride, halcyon days of success and fun and mirth in connection with sport. That&#39;s the way it should be - after all it is about passion, not fashion. </p>
