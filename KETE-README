to use:
script/generate authenticated user account --svn
Note: when I used the generator on my Mac OS X machine, I got an error about zoom not being found.  See the comment in vendor/plugins/acts_as_zoom/lib/acts_as_zoom.rb for how to work around this.  Basically, you probably have the non-Macports version of ruby being selected.  Use "which ruby" to see.  This may also cause postgres ruby driver not to be found.

Gems:
Rmagick, used by attachment_fu, see install directions in blog.katipo.co.nz

Zebra:

See README under the zebradb directory, note that you will probably want to update zebradb/keteaccess and db/bootstrap/zoom_dbs.yml to suit.  Do this before bootstrapping.

Perl Zoom.pm:

You may encounter an error where Zoom.pm isn't found, even after installing it.  This is caused by the she-bang line pointing at the wrong installation of perl.  If you have installed perl/Zoom.pm via my Macports instructions for Mac OS X, you will need to change it to /opt/local/bin/perl as noted in comments in the acts_as_zoom/lib/zoom_ext_services_action.pl file.

Bootstrapping:
To get your migrations in and then load with some baseline data use the following:

rake db:bootstrap FIXTURES=zoom_dbs.yml,topic_types.yml,topic_type_fields.yml,topic_type_to_field_mappings.yml,baskets.yml,web_links.yml,web_link_versions.yml,users.yml,roles.yml,roles_users.yml,contributions.yml

Note the fixtures argument is important for the correct order of loading of the data.  Foreign keys will fail in PostgreSQL otherwise.

Starting server with Mongrel on port 80 for development:

sudo mongrel_rails start -p 80 --user your_user --group your_group

or to run the production environment in the background (i.e. a daemon)

sudo mongrel_rails start -e production -p 80 --user your_user --group your_group -d

to shutdown daemon:

mongrel_rails stop

TODO: mongrel_cluster notes

Demo:

To create a demo with included data do the following (you may want your demo on development instead, adjust to suit):

rake db:make_demo RAILS_ENV=production FIXTURES=zoom_dbs.yml,topic_types.yml,topic_type_fields.yml,topic_type_to_field_mappings.yml,baskets.yml,users.yml,roles.yml,roles_users.yml,topics.yml,topic_versions.yml,web_links.yml,web_link_versions.yml,videos.yml,video_versions.yml,audio_recordings.yml,audio_recording_versions.yml,still_images.yml,still_image_versions.yml,image_files.yml,contributions.yml,content_item_relations.yml
