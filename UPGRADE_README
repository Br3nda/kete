= Incremental Upgrade Instructions
Originally contributed by James Stradling <james@katipo.co.nz> - 2008-05-16

This file details upgrade instructions for Kete trunk versions.
Revisions that require migrations and/or extra upgrade steps are detailed below.

It is assumed you are upgrading from an earlier functional and unmodified trunk version.


== Trunk r1169 - Content Licensing Controls Added

This version includes content licensing controls in addition to the privacy control functionality added in r1148.
The following instructions are for use when updating from a trunk version of Kete to a version r1169 or later.

NB: All commands must be made from the main Kete application directory.

1.      Stop your Kete server.
2.      Run the database migration 'rake db:migrate'
                NB: This adds new columns and tables in the kete database. If you have customized Kete or
                need to reverse the upgrade, this may cause issues. See migrations 046 through 060 in
                /db/migrate/ for an insight into the database schema changes made.
3.      Run the upgrade script: 'rake kete:upgrade'
4.      Start your Kete server again.

Optionally, you can run rake acts_as_licensed:import_nz_cc_licenses to add Creative Commons New Zealand licenses options to your Kete instance.
