owners are always groups

owner scope = /owner_name/topics, /owner_name/web_links, etc.

when an owner visits the url, they are shown public and private

non-owners only shown public items

users belong to groups through memberships

user may have topic as profile

group may have topic as profile

group members have three roles: admin, moderator, member

there is a default group for the site at large with admins, moderators, and members

site moderators can not moderate private topics/items, only moderators for that specific group

all models that can be owned, have an owning_group_id which equals group_id
