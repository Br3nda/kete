= Selenium Testing =

Most of the work is done for you.

Just open test/selenium/test_helper.rb, and change the following variables:
  SELENIUM_WEB_SERVER_URL
  SELENIUM_WEB_SERVER_PORT
  SELENIUM_SERVER_PORT (only if you have port 4444 being used for something else)
  SELENIUM_SERVER_BROWSER (your browser of choice, prefixed by an astrix (*). Safari has some issues)
  SELENIUM_SERVER_TIMEOUT (10000 (10 seconds) should be enough, but if you have a slow PC/Mac, increase this)

Save the file, then in your Rails root, run

rake test:selenium

Enjoy!

= Writing more Tests =
* Use the Firefox plugin Selenium IDE, and turn the format to "Ruby - Selenium RC"
* Record the actions
* Then copy the test method to a new test case (making the necessary changes to fit how tests are run)
