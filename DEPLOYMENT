# Deployment Considerations #

  * Note the two following nginx settings will be wiped by doing a chef-update, and will need to be re-added.

  * Prevent 502 errors from Nginx from huge cookies. `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:

        proxy_buffer_size   32k;
        proxy_buffers   6 32k;

  * Make sure the static assets are served with caching headers. `etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`: 

        location ~ ^/(system|assets|image_files|audio|video|documents)/  {

  * Look for info that needs updating in `app/models/system_setting.rb`, especially server names, URLs and email addresses.
