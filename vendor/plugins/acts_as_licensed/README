ActsAsLicenced
=====================

Some portions (rails generator) based on work by Rob Sanheim in the BrainBuster rails plugin.

ActsAsLicensed relies on three methods within the class you add acts_as_licensed to. They are title_for_license, author_for_license, and author_url_for_license

The defaults are usually similar to the following (adjust to suit your application):

def title_for_license
  title
end
def author_for_license
  self.author.name
end
def author_url_for_license
  "/site/account/show/#{author_id}"
end

You can also define a default license by setting DEFAULT_CONTENT_LICENSE somewhere in your initializers (the constant contains the id of a license in the license table).
