/* ################################## Left to Right specific rules ############################## */

   These rules can't be declared in base.css, as it is always loaded, and if they are declared
   they will make base-rtl.css in effective for certain rules.

   In other words, these are rules that once defined, can't be reset. So we separate them out
   so that they only get declared if needed.
