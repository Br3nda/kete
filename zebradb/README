----
Purpose:

This directory holds your Kete application's Zebra (http://indexdata.dk/zebra/) related files.  Zebra is used by Kete to carry out full text searches, as well as be another interface to it's data via Z39.50 and ZOOM by other services.

Before you startup Kete, you will need to have Zebra installed on you machine, your Zebra databases (public and private dbs) initialized, updated your zebra password file, and started up your zebra listening instances.  The good news that we have done all the hard configuration.

You may also need to poke holes in your firewall, depending on your setup.

----
Zebra Installation:

See http://blog.katipo.co.nz/?p=26 for details on how (and what) to install Zebra for Kete on Debian Etch (testing at the time of this writing).  Other howtos likely to follow, but not available now.

----
Configuration:

In this directory, use the htpasswd command to update the keteaccess file.

----
Initialize Your Zebra Databases:

From this directory (it is important to actualy run commands while cd'ing into the appropriate directory):
$ cd private
$ zebraidx -c ../conf/zebra-private.cfg -d private init
$ zebraidx -c ../conf/zebra-private.cfg -d private commit
$ cd ../public
$ zebraidx -c ../conf/zebra-public.cfg -d public init
$ zebraidx -c ../conf/zebra-public.cfg -d public commit

----
Startup Zebra:

In this directory (it is important to actualy run commands while in the directory):

TODO: update this to reflect that you probably want to run this in the background.
$ zebrasrv -f conf/kete-zebra-servers.xml

You may want to change the ports your Zebra databases are listening on, if so you'll need to edit your Kete setup below to reflect that.

----
For Kete:

You'll want to edit db/bootstrap/zoom_dbs.yml entries for your passwords to match the keteaccess file BEFORE running "rake db:bootstrap".

If you want to add other optional Z39.50 servers to query, you can do so under /zoom_dbs/ in the web interface.
